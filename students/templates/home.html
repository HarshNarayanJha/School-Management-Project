    <p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: monospace;">
    The class teacher will create a new Exam, enter the primary details (exam name, session, class), and save it.
    (hence: if one exam is conducted in multiple classes together, then each class will have its own exam under the same name),
    <code style="background-color: black; color: white;">save and continue editing</code> it, then all the students in that class
    will be pre-poulated in the Results section, and each subject teacher just has to enter the marks of each student.
    <br /><br />
    Each student page is also acquired by a Results section, in which each Exam is listed together with that students Marks
    <br /><br />
    We can create students, teacher etc. I am planning to create an csv parser for easy students creation...
    <br /><br />
    Next goal is to hookup Teacher creation wth Django User system, so that we can authenticate Teachers.

    Note: This page is yet to be designed...
